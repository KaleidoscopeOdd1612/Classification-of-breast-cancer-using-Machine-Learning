# Classification-of-breast-cancer-using-Machine-Learning
An experiment of classify between malignant (M) indicating cancerous tumors,  or benign (B) indicating non-cancerous tumors using various machince learning model. This project mainly using sklearn library with python language in Jupyter notebook. The positive class of this project is cancerous tumors which mean that our main goal is to reduce false negative, which are a misclassification of model from cancerous tumors to non-cancerous tumors. There are total of 3 type of machine learning model use in this project namely, `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Tree` and `Random Forest`.
