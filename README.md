# Classification-of-breast-cancer-using-Machine-Learning
An experiment of classify between malignant (M) indicating cancerous tumors,  or benign (B) indicating non-cancerous tumors using various machince learning model. This project mainly using sklearn library with python language in Jupyter notebook. The main goal is to reduce false negative, which are a misclassification of model from cancerous tumors to non-cancerous tumors. There are total of 3 type of machine learning model use in this project namely, `Logistic Regression`, `Decision Tree` and `Random Forest`.
